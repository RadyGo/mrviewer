mrViewer
--------

	Playback
	--------


	Bugs
	----

	- FLU file requester can hang.  -- postscript delegate ???
	  wandImage hangs with pdf.tgz of xemacs.

	- Hotkeys listed in popup menu not working.  Can this be 
	  automated by keeping popup menu around?

	- Exit while playing can lead to signal 11.

	Installer
	---------

	- Add mrViewer's icon to installer's shortcut.
	  Make icon for i686 and x86_64 versions.

	Priorities
	----------

	- Improve audio/video sync
	- Change Reel to use EDL Timeline with tracks.
	- Make sure new installer works as good as old one.
	- Fix differences in text sizes between win32/linux.
	- Split audio engines into a dso/dll loading at runtime.
	- Split draw  engines into a dso/dll loading at runtime.
	- Split postgreSQL into a dso/dll loading at runtime.
	- Split mrViewer into main and a library. **ALMOST DONE**
	- Crate maya plugin that opens mrViewer.
	- Add a hotkeys widget
	- Add stereo playback

	Improvements
	------------
	
	- Add statistics window (skipped frames, current display,
	  # of cache video frames, audio frames, etc)

	- Add hotkeys window and allow user to change hotkeys.

	- Gamma and gain should be different for fg and bg images.
	  Lut too.  mrvDrawEngine/GLEngine should be modified to make
	  this more generic.

	- mrvGLEngine should be split into mrvGLTexture and mrvGLEngine.

	- Pixel color queries should allow returning original float values
	  (as now), color corrected float color values and 
	  8-bit quantized values of either.

	- Timeline should allow displaying time of current movie or
	  full edl, even when in edl mode.

	- Add subtitles support.

	- Add Y, U, V display, YUV pixel info, color information and 
	  histogram.


	Code issues
	-----------

	- baseImage* are used in some non-multithread safe ways, like in
	  mrvColorInfo.  Make them thread safe.

	- Drawing functions is *too* complex due to handling quads, 8bits,
	  floats and caches.  ** A TAD IMPROVED **

	- Updating of histogram and vectorscope is done on main thread.
	  Don't do this.  Histogram and vectorscope should have a bitmap
	  and main thread should just display this bitmap.


	Maya integration
	----------------

	- Add Maya hook to save/load scenes.
	- Add hook to display "depth pixel information" (normal, point, etc),
	  based on throwing a ray thru camera.


	FLU
	---

	- FLU file requester should really be simplified -- too much
	  ugly code in there.  Use boost::filename
	- File browser is not displaying preview of image sequences.
	- File browser should display image icon instead of generic icon.
	- FLU file requester should update thumbnails of recognized images
	  on background in main mode.

	Image Information
	-----------------
	- Closing mrvImageInformation's groups is not permanent
	  when switching among two images.

	- ICC should allow loading them.

	- Closing tabs in image information should redraw scroller.
	  window->redraw() needed.

	- Resizing of image information window leads to issues when scrollbar
	  appears

	Database
	--------
	- Postgress library should be loaded on demand, not linked onto
	  the executable.
	- Same with MySQL.

	Ruby
	----
	- Create nice HTML code for ruby on rails database.
	- Create CSS stylesheets for HTML code.

	Features
	--------
	- Simple effects:  mirror, flip, rotate
	- LightTable view (to compare 4-6 more pictures)
	- Batch renamer
	- Sets (grouping of pics)
	- Finding/Sorting
	- Slideshow
	- Save Slideshow as movie
	- Add watermark to web preview
	- Clean-up names
	- Add Crop/Rotate/Resize/Transform/Remove Grain/Remove Red Eyes
	- Adjust HSV, Negative, Levels, Color Balance, Brightness, Contrast
	- Printing (PDF/Printer)
	- FLU file icons should be of arbitrary size.





Make a command-line mrViewer's core format -> AVI using ffmpeg.
This will force the creation of libmrvcore.so and removal of any non-core
dependencies.





Frame Cycler
------------

	* Better command-line, with compositing
	* LTC audio playback (??) - timecode encoded as audio
	* SDI support to have GUI and playback in different screens.
	* XML configurable GUI.
	* REDCode RAW
	* Versioning of elements (using file system conventions)
	* Advanced timing using opengl refresh
	* YIQ invalid display
	* Review link transmits commands over TCP/IP.  No other data.
	* Thumbnail size and aspect ratio (at least on file requester).
