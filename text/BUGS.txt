BUGS:

	- DEMOREEL2007 jumps to sound.
	  DEMOREEL2007 does not loop correctly and audio becomes out of sync.
	


	FIX NOW !!!
	-----------

	- Stop should rebind images.

	- Caching of image sequences is broken.

	- Looping works wrong due to decode thread getting too ahead.
	  This makes it not respect gui loop option until next loop.

	- Audio in some videos crashes the viewer.

	- 32-bits viewer on linux crashes.

	- Seek repeats audio packets? (see cascade_HD - try near 
	  chips 00::20:00) so even a-v will be 1/0, it is still wrong.

	- Audio seek is wrong for ilotm.avi (try single step to see).

	- Audio (packet?) sometimes is not retrieved and hangs playback when in
	  ffplay mode. ( iceegg-Ice_Age*, New_Summoner_h264.mov ).

	- FLU image preview has bad redraw and shifts image to 0,0 of
	  file requester.

	- No looping in image sequences.
	     This needs to work like movies, as in the future
	     we will probably not cache images in memory anymore.

	     decode loop gets image(s)
	     video thread decode is empty

	- Reverse playback audio is out of sync ( spiderman.divx ), even
	  with old caching method.

	- Masking has round-off errors.  Try milkgirls with 2.10 Vistavision.

	- YUV420 image of odd X or Y res is wrong 
	  ( h9_demos.mov, New_Summoner_h264.mov ).
	  Creates green edge.  Green edge is worse than in ffplay?

	- Gamma pulldown menu makes hole in opengl window when refreshing.

TODO:
	- mrv::media and mrv::gui::media is confusing and kind of reversed.
