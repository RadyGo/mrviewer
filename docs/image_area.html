<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">The Image Area</h3>

The Image Area is your main viewport. &nbsp;It usually displays one
image at a time, albeit in the future it will be possible to display
several images together.<br>

<br>

Within your viewport, your mouse pointer will change to a cross to more
clearly indicate what pixel you are pointing at.<br>

<br>

You can manipulate the viewport using your mouse and hotkeys in a
similar way to how maya and 3dmax work. &nbsp;Using your mousewheel
you
are able to zoom in and out from the pixel your cursor is pointing at.<br>

<br>

Using the
<div class="hotkey">LMB</div>

you can select an
area. &nbsp;The main purpose of selecting an area currently is to
get
the color information of the whole area. &nbsp;See <a href="color_area.html">The Color Area Window</a>.<br>

<br>

Using the
<div class="hotkey">MMB</div>

or
<div class="hotkey">ALT+LMB</div>

,
you can scroll around the image canvas.<br>

<br>

Using the
<div class="hotkey">Mousewheel</div>

, you can zoom in and out of the location where the mouse is pointing
at.<br>

<br>

Using the
<div class="hotkey">RMB</div>

, you can bring up a context sensitive menu to allow you
open new windows, copy pixel values or add and change some image
properties.
