with your Browser</h1>Depending on whether you have rails setup
to work in development mode or in production mode, the location of
where the web page for your database will vary.<br>During
development, you can find the rails project at the machine's 3000 port.
&nbsp;Once the rails project is deployed, you will find it at the IP
address or web address that you have decided to install it under.<br><br>For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be assuming we are in development mode.<br>If you are currently logged in in the database machine, this
usually means pointing your browser to:<br><br><div class="list">http://localhost:3000</div><br>Once
you arrive there, you will be able to navigate to the administration,
shows, sequences, shots, audios, images, videos and categories sections.<br><br>Thus, to access the images section, you would do:<br><br><div class="list">http://localhost:3000/images</div><br>The
administrative section is special, as it allows changing a lot of
sensitive things. &nbsp;As such, that section is protected by a
username and password. &nbsp;<br><br>By default, the only user that
will be able to access the administrative section is 'admin' with
password 'admin'. &nbsp;Needless to say, you should change at least the
password before you deploy the database.<br><br></body></html>
