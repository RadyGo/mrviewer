<h4>Movies do not play back smoothly in reverse.</h4>

Whenever I try to play back a movie in reverse, the playback is choppy.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Answer:</span><br>

<span style="font-family: monospace;">Smooth playback of movies in
reverse is highly dependant on the speed of your computer as well as
the resolution and&nbsp;codec used to encode the movie. &nbsp;A lot of codecs assume the
playback is always done forwards and encode frames by taking advantage
of frame differences.<br>Sometimes to decode even one frame it is
needed to know up to a second of all the frames that came before it
(and sometimes after it, too).<br>
When playing back in reverse, it means mrViewer needs to work harder in
decoding several back frames before the current frame is actually
displayed. &nbsp;If your computer is not fast enough to decode those
frames under the fps playback, you will see the playback stutter.<br>If
your movie contains audio, you can often improve reverse playback by
turning off the audio by going to the audio track selection button and
selecting &lt;no audio&gt;.<br> </span>
