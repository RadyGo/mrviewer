<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Installing mrViewer</span></h2>


Installation of mrViewer is done simply by clicking on the icon for its
installer or by executing the file in a console or shell window.<br>


The installer is multiplatform, and will install all versions of
mrViewer under a common root directory.<br>


Installation of mrViewer often requires you to have root or System
Administrator permissions. &nbsp;If you run the installer as a
normal
user, you might only be able to install mrViewer to some non-standard
installation directory, like your home directory.<br>


The installer can also be run in silent mode for remote installs in
case you want to install mrViewer locally on each machine on your
network.<br>
