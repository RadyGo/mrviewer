BUGS
----

+ On win32, if window shows up outside view area, we get redraw issues.
  On fullscreen resize, we get problems too.  
  ** MOST SERIOUS BUG, GFX CARD RELATED - NUKE HAS ISSUES TOO **
+ Cursor does not change correctly.  Reverts to default.
+ Displaying a large wandImage jpeg takes a long time.  Why?
+ FLU file requester first icon shows a little bit down first time window
  is opened.
+ FLU file requester shows lists of movies as sequences (need button to
  avoid this).



THINGS I DON'T LIKE IN MY CODE
------------------------------

* lack of C++ namespace use or a common prefix like mr in 
  mrClasses/mrLiquid.  Use namespace mrv. **IN PROGRESS**
* Make image browser and image view not use any globals, but use a 
  pointer within each to allow for multiple viewers eventually. **IN PROGRESS**
* Add a nicer display of image's properties (with ability to change them)
* Use of C++ for GUI, instead of scripting language.
* sound code needs to be moved to its own place
* Decoding of sound and video need to be done on its own thread.
* Playing of sound also needs to be in a separate thread (this thread should
  play all sounds from all images)
* Make quicktime and avi loaders plugins
